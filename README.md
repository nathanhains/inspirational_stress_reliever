# Inspirational Stress Reliever
First CLI project for Flatiron's Software Engineering Bootcamp. This project will output an inspirational quote depending on whether or not the user is feeling stressed.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemflie:

```ruby
gem 'eden_events'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install eden_events

## Usage

You can use this to to implement a choice of how many(of infinite) quotes a user wants & then provide a history/list to choose authors from.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run 'bin/setup/ to install dependencies. You can also run 'bin/console' for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem on your local machine, run 'bundle exec rake install.' To release a new version, update the version number in 'version.rb' , and then run 'bundle exec rake release', which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tage, and push the '.gem' file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
